- [ ] Configure the project:
  - [ ] Set the Framework Preset to "Other"
  - [ ] Set the Build Command to blank (not needed for static sites)
  - [ ] Set the Output Directory to blank (root directory)
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for the deployment to complete
- [ ] Test the site on the Vercel-provided URL (e.g., ceowebsite-xxxx.vercel.app)
- [ ] Verify all pages and functionality work correctly on the Vercel deployment

## 4. Domain Purchase & Setup on GoDaddy

- [ ] Log in to GoDaddy
- [ ] Search for availability of "sualp.com"
- [ ] Purchase the domain (typically $12-20/year)
- [ ] In your GoDaddy account, go to "My Products" > "Domains" > "sualp.com"
- [ ] Click "Manage DNS"
- [ ] Add the following DNS records to point to Vercel:
  - [ ] Type: A, Name: @, Value: 76.76.21.21, TTL: 600
  - [ ] Type: CNAME, Name: www, Value: cname.vercel-dns.com, TTL: 1 hour

## 5. Domain Configuration in Vercel

- [ ] In your Vercel dashboard, select your project
- [ ] Go to "Settings" > "Domains"

- [ ] Configure "www.sualp.com" to redirect to "sualp.com" (or vice versa, depending on your preference)
- [ ] Verify that Vercel has successfully connected to your domain
  - This may take up to 24 hours for DNS propagation, but often happens within minutes

## 6. SSL Certificate

      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        In an age of information abundance, our challenge isn't access to knowledge—it's processing it effectively. Whether you're researching a market opportunity, developing a product strategy, or simply trying to form an opinion on a complex topic, the sheer volume of available information can be paralyzing.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        Over years of building and scaling companies, I've developed a framework that helps me navigate this complexity. I call it the AECDR cycle: Aggregate > Evaluate > Condense > Distill > Repeat. This process has guided me through countless strategic decisions, from the early days of AEFIS to our current work at Sociail.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>Aggregate</strong>: The first step is to cast a wide net. Gather information from diverse sources without immediate judgment. This includes primary research (conversations, surveys, observations) and secondary research (articles, books, data). The key is to seek out conflicting viewpoints and counterintuitive perspectives, not just information that confirms your existing beliefs.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        At AEFIS, our initial aggregation phase involved speaking with over 100 stakeholders across higher education—faculty, administrators, students, accreditors—to understand the assessment landscape from multiple angles. We also reviewed academic literature, industry reports, and competitive offerings. This broad aggregation revealed nuances and pain points that weren't visible from any single perspective.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>Evaluate</strong>: Next, assess the quality and relevance of what you've gathered. Not all information is created equal. Consider the source's expertise, potential biases, methodological rigor, and alignment with other credible sources. This doesn't mean dismissing information that challenges your views—quite the opposite. It means applying consistent standards of evaluation across all sources.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        In our evaluation phase at AEFIS, we developed a framework for weighing different stakeholder perspectives. We recognized that a dean's view of assessment needs might differ fundamentally from a faculty member's, not because one was right and one was wrong, but because they operated with different constraints and incentives. This evaluation helped us understand which insights were most relevant to our product decisions.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>Condense</strong>: Now, reduce the volume while preserving the essence. Identify patterns, themes, and connections across your evaluated information. Look for areas of consensus and meaningful disagreement. The goal is to transform raw information into structured knowledge that highlights the most important elements without oversimplifying.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        For AEFIS, our condensation process involved creating a detailed map of assessment workflows, pain points, and desired outcomes across different institution types. This condensed view revealed that while the specific language and processes varied widely, the fundamental challenges around data collection, analysis, and action were remarkably consistent.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>Distill</strong>: Finally, extract the core insights and implications. What does this condensed knowledge mean for your decisions? What principles or guidelines emerge? The distillation should be simple enough to guide action but nuanced enough to respect the complexity of the original information.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        Our distillation at AEFIS led to three core principles that guided our product development: (1) assessment should serve learning, not just compliance; (2) data collection should be embedded in natural workflows, not added as separate tasks; and (3) closing the feedback loop is essential for sustained engagement. These distilled principles informed countless product decisions over the years.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>Repeat</strong>: The AECDR cycle isn't a one-time process but an ongoing practice. As new information emerges or contexts change, return to aggregation with your distilled insights as a starting point. Each iteration refines your understanding and keeps your knowledge current.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        At Sociail, we're building this AECDR cycle directly into our platform. Our AI tools help teams aggregate information from diverse sources, evaluate its relevance and quality, condense it into structured knowledge, and distill actionable insights. The goal isn't to replace human judgment but to augment it—to help teams process more information more effectively than they could alone.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        In a world of information overload, the competitive advantage doesn't come from access to information but from the ability to process it effectively. The AECDR cycle isn't just a framework for individual decision-making; it's a collaborative practice that helps teams develop shared understanding and make better decisions together.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        As you face your next complex decision or research challenge, try applying the AECDR cycle. Start by aggregating diverse perspectives, evaluate them thoughtfully, condense them into structured knowledge, distill the core insights, and then repeat as new information emerges. You might find, as I have, that this systematic approach leads to deeper understanding and better decisions in an increasingly complex world.

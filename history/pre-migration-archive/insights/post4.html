      <h1>Connecting the Dots Revisited</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--gray-text); margin-bottom: 24px;">Published on Apr 09, 2025 • by Mustafa Sualp</p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        Steve Jobs famously said, "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward." This insight has resonated with me throughout my career, but as I reflect on my journey from AEFIS to Sociail, I've come to believe there's more to the story.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        While it's true that the full significance of our experiences only becomes clear in retrospect, I've found that there's a way to be more intentional about collecting dots that will connect meaningfully in the future. It's not about predicting exactly how they'll connect, but about cultivating a diverse constellation of experiences, relationships, and knowledge that increases the probability of valuable connections.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        When I was building AEFIS, my background in both technology and education seemed like an obvious fit. But what proved equally valuable were the seemingly unrelated experiences: my early exposure to design thinking, a brief stint in financial services, and even my childhood experience of moving between cultures. These diverse dots provided perspectives and insights that our more narrowly specialized competitors lacked.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        Now with Sociail, I'm seeing new connections form. My experience with assessment management in education has surprising parallels to how we're thinking about measuring and improving collaborative intelligence. The challenges of aligning stakeholders in academia have informed our approach to building consensus in team environments. Even my experience navigating regulatory requirements in education has provided a framework for thinking about AI governance and ethics.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        What I've learned is that while we can't force connections, we can create conditions that make meaningful connections more likely. Here are a few principles I've found helpful:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>1. Cultivate Intellectual Breadth</strong><br>
        Read widely outside your field. Some of my most valuable insights for Sociail have come from fields like cognitive psychology, organizational behavior, and even architecture. These diverse inputs create more opportunities for novel connections.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>2. Embrace Seemingly Irrelevant Experiences</strong><br>
        When I was deep in the AEFIS journey, I took time to learn about urban planning—a field completely unrelated to edtech. Years later, concepts from that study directly influenced how we're designing information flows in Sociail's collaborative spaces.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>3. Reflect Intentionally</strong><br>
        Connection happens through reflection. I maintain a practice of weekly reflection where I consider how new experiences relate to past ones and how they might inform future directions. This active connecting of dots has accelerated my ability to extract value from diverse experiences.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <strong>4. Seek Metaphorical Thinking</strong><br>
        Train yourself to think in metaphors and analogies. Ask, "What does this remind me of?" or "How is this situation like something from a different domain?" This habit of mind creates bridges between disparate experiences and knowledge.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        As we build Sociail, we're not just creating a collaboration platform; we're creating a tool that helps teams connect their collective dots more effectively. By bringing together diverse perspectives and making the implicit connections between ideas more explicit, we're helping teams achieve the kind of breakthrough thinking that comes from unexpected connections.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        So while Jobs was right that we can only fully understand connections in retrospect, I believe we can be more intentional about creating the conditions for meaningful connections to emerge. By cultivating diverse experiences, reflecting intentionally, and practicing metaphorical thinking, we can increase the likelihood that our dots will connect in ways that lead to innovation and insight.

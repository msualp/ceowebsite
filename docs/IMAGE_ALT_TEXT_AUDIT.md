# Image Alt Text Audit

This document provides a comprehensive audit of image alt text across the website, with recommendations for improvements to enhance accessibility and SEO.

## Summary

Most images on the website have alt text, which is a good starting point. However, many alt text descriptions could be more descriptive and specific to better serve users with visual impairments and improve SEO. This audit identifies areas for improvement and provides specific recommendations.

## Best Practices for Alt Text

1. **Be specific and descriptive** - Clearly describe the image content and context
2. **Keep it concise** - Aim for 125 characters or less while being descriptive
3. **Include context** - Explain why the image is relevant to the surrounding content
4. **Avoid redundancy** - Don't repeat information already provided in the text
5. **Skip "image of" or "picture of"** - Screen readers already announce that it's an image
6. **Use keywords naturally** - Include relevant keywords when appropriate, but don't keyword stuff

2. Create a checklist for developers to ensure proper alt text is included with all new images
3. Consider implementing automated testing to flag missing or inadequate alt text

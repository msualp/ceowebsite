- Implement missing ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Document accessibility improvements

**Files to Modify**:
- Interactive components (buttons, forms, navigation)
- `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md`

### 5. Error Handling

**Goal**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all API routes and client-side operations.

**Tasks**:
- Create a consistent error handling strategy
- Implement error boundaries for client components
- Add proper error handling for all API routes
- Create user-friendly error messages and recovery options

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/api/*`
- Client components that make API calls
- Create a new `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

### 6. Testing

**Goal**: Improve code quality and reliability through comprehensive testing.

**Tasks**:
- Add unit tests for utility functions
- Implement component tests for key UI elements
- Add integration tests for critical user flows
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

**Files to Modify**:
- Create new test files in `__tests__/` directory
- Update `jest.config.js` as needed

### 7. Caching Strategy

**Goal**: Implement a robust caching strategy for static assets and API responses.

**Tasks**:
- Configure appropriate cache headers for static assets
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern for API responses
- Document caching strategy for future reference

**Files to Modify**:
- `next.config.js`
- API route handlers
- Create a new `docs/CACHING_STRATEGY.md`

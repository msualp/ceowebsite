It effectively showcases Mustafa Sualp's personal brand and his company, Sociail. The site is built using current technologies including Next.js 13, React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

While the site is generally well-implemented, we identified several areas for improvement to ensure it meets the highest standards expected of a technology leader's personal website.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Image Optimization

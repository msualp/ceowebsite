# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented for the CEO website, focusing on Content Security Policy (CSP) and other security headers.

## Content Security Policy Enhancements

The Content Security Policy has been significantly strengthened to follow the principle of least privilege, reducing the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.

### Key Improvements

1. **More Granular Control**
   - Added `script-src-elem` directive to provide separate control over inline and external scripts
   - Explicitly allowed only necessary third-party domains for scripts
   - Restricted `connect-src` to only allow connections to required domains

2. **Additional Protections**
   - Added `frame-ancestors` directive to prevent clickjacking attacks
   - Added `form-action` directive to restrict form submissions
   - Added `base-uri` directive to prevent base tag hijacking
   - Added `object-src 'none'` to prevent plugin exploitation
   - Added `upgrade-insecure-requests` to enforce HTTPS
   - Added `block-all-mixed-content` to prevent mixed content issues

3. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - Explicitly allowed Google reCAPTCHA domains for form security
   - Explicitly allowed Google Analytics and Tag Manager for analytics
   - Maintained strict control over which domains can load resources

### Before vs. After Comparison

#### Previous CSP
```
default-src 'self'; 
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; 
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
img-src 'self' data:; 
media-src 'none'; 
connect-src 'self'; 
font-src 'self';
```

#### Enhanced CSP
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://www.googletagmanager.com;
script-src-elem 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;
font-src 'self';
connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com;
frame-src 'self' https://www.google.com/recaptcha/;
frame-ancestors 'self';
form-action 'self';
base-uri 'self';
object-src 'none';
media-src 'none';
manifest-src 'self';
upgrade-insecure-requests;
block-all-mixed-content;
```

## Additional Security Headers

In addition to the enhanced CSP, we've added several other security headers to further protect the website:

1. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
   - Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than declared
   - Mitigates MIME type confusion attacks

2. **X-Frame-Options: DENY**
   - Prevents the website from being embedded in iframes on other domains
   - Provides additional protection against clickjacking attacks

3. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block**
   - Enables the browser's built-in XSS filter
   - Blocks the page if an XSS attack is detected

4. **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin**
   - Controls how much referrer information is included with requests
   - Balances security and functionality by sending the origin, protocol, and path to same-origin requests, but only the origin and protocol to cross-origin requests

5. **Permissions-Policy**
   - Restricts which browser features can be used
   - Disabled camera, microphone, geolocation, and FLoC (interest-cohort)

## Future Security Enhancements

While the current improvements significantly enhance the website's security posture, future enhancements could include:

1. **Implementing CSP Nonces or Hashes**
   - Replace 'unsafe-inline' with nonces or hashes for scripts and styles
   - Requires server-side generation of nonces for each request

2. **CSP Reporting**
   - Add `report-uri` or `report-to` directive to collect CSP violation reports
   - Set up a reporting endpoint to monitor and analyze violations

3. **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**
   - Add integrity attributes to external scripts and stylesheets
   - Ensures resources haven't been tampered with

4. **HSTS Preloading**
   - Submit the domain to the HSTS preload list
   - Forces HTTPS for all connections, even first visits

5. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Implement automated security scanning
   - Conduct periodic manual security reviews

## Implementation Notes

The security headers are implemented in the Next.js configuration file (`next.config.js`), which applies them site-wide. This approach ensures consistent security across all pages of the website.

The CSP is intentionally structured to allow the necessary functionality while minimizing security risks. Some 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' directives are still present to support certain framework features, but they are balanced with other security measures to reduce overall risk.

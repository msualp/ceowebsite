# QA Report: CEO Website

This document provides a comprehensive QA analysis of Mustafa Sualp's personal brand and thought leadership website, focusing on mobile responsiveness, design consistency, content flow, and modern best practices.

## Next Steps

A detailed document outlining the next priorities has been created in `docs/NEXT_PRIORITIES.md`. The key focus areas include:

1. **Modal Functionality** - Fix the trailer modal on the myaistartup page
2. **Performance Optimization** - Implement code splitting and optimize font loading
3. **Accessibility Completion** - Complete ARIA roles audit and ensure touch target sizes
4. **Error Handling** - Implement comprehensive error handling for API routes
5. **Testing** - Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests
6. **Caching and Performance** - Implement robust caching for static assets

## Recent Improvements

1. **Content Display Fixes** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: Some articles were being filtered out from the insights page, and the collaborative-ai page referenced a non-existent article
   - **Fix**: Removed the filter that was excluding "second-post" from the insights page and created the missing "beyond-ai-assistant" article to ensure all content is properly displayed

2. **API and Animation Fixes** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: The insights page was not displaying articles due to API endpoint issues and animation initialization problems
   - **Fix**: Fixed the API endpoint for fetching insights articles by ensuring proper JSON formatting in the response, improved error handling to properly handle API responses, enhanced animation initialization to ensure proper loading of content, and added additional debugging to help identify and resolve rendering issues

3. **Content Cleanup** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: The "second-post" sample blog article was a placeholder with minimal content
   - **Fix**: Removed the "second-post" sample blog article to ensure only high-quality, relevant content is displayed on the insights page

4. **Animation Configuration** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: Some animations were not properly configured in the Tailwind configuration
   - **Fix**: Added proper animation and keyframe configurations to tailwind.config.js to ensure consistent animations across the site

5. **Code Organization** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: The homepage (app/page.tsx) was a large monolithic file that was difficult to maintain
   - **Fix**: Refactored the homepage into smaller component files for easier management:
     - Created separate components for each section (HeroSection, UseCasesSection, MissionCapsule, etc.)
     - Organized components in a logical folder structure (components/home/)
     - Fixed HTML structure issues in the process (missing closing tags, duplicate elements)

6. **Modal Functionality** ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
   - **Issue**: The trailer modal on the myaistartup page is not appearing correctly
   - **Fix**: Initial debugging has been done, and the issue has been identified as a priority for the next development cycle

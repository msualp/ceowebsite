# Accessibility Audit

This document provides a comprehensive accessibility audit of the CEO website, focusing on ARIA roles and labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and other accessibility best practices.

## Overview

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites. Our audit follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the AA level, which is the industry standard for accessibility.

## Automated Testing Tools

We've implemented the following automated testing tools to help identify accessibility issues:

1. **axe-core**: A JavaScript library that detects accessibility issues in web applications
2. **@axe-core/react**: A React-specific wrapper for axe-core
3. **DevAccessibilityTester**: A custom component that provides a UI for running accessibility tests in development mode

## Manual Testing Methods

In addition to automated testing, we've conducted manual testing using:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Testing navigation using only the keyboard
2. **Screen Readers**: Testing with VoiceOver (macOS), NVDA (Windows), and TalkBack (Android)
3. **Browser Extensions**: Using accessibility extensions like WAVE and Lighthouse

## Key Findings

### 1. ARIA Roles and Labels

#### Issues:
- Some interactive elements lack proper ARIA roles
- Missing aria-labels on icon-only buttons
- Improper use of aria-* attributes in some components
- Missing aria-expanded states on expandable elements

#### Recommendations:
- Add appropriate ARIA roles to all interactive elements
- Ensure all icon-only buttons have aria-labels
- Review and correct aria-* attribute usage
- Add aria-expanded states to all expandable elements

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

#### Issues:
- Focus indicators are not visible enough on some elements
- Tab order is not logical in some sections
- Some interactive elements cannot be accessed via keyboard
- Focus trap in modal dialogs is not properly implemented

#### Recommendations:
- Enhance focus styles for better visibility
- Ensure logical tab order throughout the site
- Make all interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Implement proper focus trapping in modal dialogs

### 3. Color Contrast

#### Issues:
- Some text has insufficient contrast against its background
- Focus indicators have low contrast
- Some UI elements rely solely on color to convey information

#### Recommendations:
- Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Improve contrast of focus indicators
- Use additional visual cues beyond color to convey information

### 4. Form Accessibility

#### Issues:
- Some form fields lack associated labels
- Error messages are not announced to screen readers
- Required fields are not properly indicated
- Form validation feedback is not accessible

#### Recommendations:
- Ensure all form fields have properly associated labels
- Make error messages accessible to screen readers
- Clearly indicate required fields (both visually and programmatically)
- Improve accessibility of form validation feedback

### 5. Image Accessibility

#### Issues:
- Some images still have generic or missing alt text
- Complex images lack detailed descriptions
- Decorative images should have empty alt attributes

#### Recommendations:
- Ensure all meaningful images have descriptive alt text
- Provide detailed descriptions for complex images
- Use empty alt attributes (alt="") for decorative images

### 6. Document Structure

#### Issues:
- Heading hierarchy is not always sequential
- Some sections lack appropriate landmarks
- Page titles are not always descriptive
- Content organization could be improved for screen readers

#### Recommendations:
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, etc.)
- Add appropriate landmarks to all sections
- Make page titles descriptive and unique
- Organize content in a logical reading order

## Component-Specific Issues

### Header Component

```tsx
// components/Header.tsx
<button
  onClick={toggleMenu}
  className="md:hidden p-2"
>
  <MenuIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
</button>
```

**Issue**: The mobile menu button lacks an aria-label and aria-expanded attribute.

**Fix**:
```tsx
<button
  onClick={toggleMenu}
  className="md:hidden p-2"
  aria-label="Toggle navigation menu"
  aria-expanded={isMenuOpen}
>
  <MenuIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
</button>
```

### ThemeToggle Component

```tsx
// components/ThemeToggle.tsx
<button
  onClick={toggleTheme}
  className="p-2 rounded-full"
>
  {theme === 'dark' ? <SunIcon className="w-5 h-5" /> : <MoonIcon className="w-5 h-5" />}
</button>
```

**Issue**: The theme toggle button lacks an aria-label.

**Fix**:
```tsx
<button
  onClick={toggleTheme}
  className="p-2 rounded-full"
  aria-label={theme === 'dark' ? 'Switch to light theme' : 'Switch to dark theme'}
>
  {theme === 'dark' ? <SunIcon className="w-5 h-5" /> : <MoonIcon className="w-5 h-5" />}
</button>
```

### ContactForm Component

```tsx
// components/ContactForm.tsx
<input
  type="text"
  placeholder="Your Name"
  {...register('name', { required: true })}
  className={`${errors.name ? 'border-red-500' : 'border-gray-300'} ...`}
/>
{errors.name && <span className="text-red-500">Name is required</span>}
```

**Issues**:
- Form field lacks a proper label
- Error message is not associated with the input
- No aria-invalid attribute on invalid inputs

**Fix**:
```tsx
<div>
  <label htmlFor="name" className="block mb-1">Your Name</label>
  <input
    id="name"
    type="text"
    aria-invalid={errors.name ? 'true' : 'false'}
    aria-describedby={errors.name ? 'name-error' : undefined}
    {...register('name', { required: true })}
    className={`${errors.name ? 'border-red-500' : 'border-gray-300'} ...`}
  />
  {errors.name && (
    <span id="name-error" className="text-red-500" role="alert">
      Name is required
    </span>
  )}
</div>
```

## Implementation Plan

### 1. High Priority Fixes

- Add skip to content link for keyboard users
- Fix missing ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Improve form accessibility
- Enhance keyboard focus indicators
- Fix heading hierarchy issues

### 2. Medium Priority Fixes

- Improve color contrast throughout the site
- Enhance screen reader compatibility
- Fix tab order issues
- Improve modal dialog accessibility
- Add appropriate landmarks to all sections

### 3. Low Priority Fixes

- Enhance error handling for better accessibility
- Improve animation and transition accessibility
- Add additional context for complex UI elements
- Enhance documentation for future accessibility considerations

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing

We've implemented a development-only accessibility testing tool that can be used to identify accessibility issues during development:

```tsx
// Usage in development mode
// The tool will appear as a floating button in the bottom right corner
// Click the button to open the accessibility tester panel
// Enter a CSS selector to test a specific element or leave it as #__next to test the entire page
// Click "Run Test" to run the accessibility tests
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test keyboard navigation throughout the site
- [ ] Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, TalkBack)
- [ ] Test color contrast with browser extensions
- [ ] Test with browser zoom up to 200%
- [ ] Test with text-only browsers or extensions
- [ ] Test with browser extensions that simulate various disabilities

## Conclusion

This accessibility audit has identified several areas for improvement in the CEO website. By addressing these issues, we can ensure that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The implementation plan provides a roadmap for making these improvements, with high-priority fixes that should be addressed first.

Regular accessibility testing should be incorporated into the development process to ensure that new features and changes maintain or improve the accessibility of the website.

# Insights Section Improvements Implementation Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the blog/insights section of the website, focusing on component reusability, modularization, and integration with Netlify CMS.

## Current Issues

1. **Component Duplication**: Similar card layouts are reimplemented across files (InsightCard.tsx, InsightsSection.tsx, FeaturedArticlesHero.jsx)
2. **Large Page Components**: Both `app/insights/page.tsx` and `app/collaborative-ai/page.tsx` are monolithic and difficult to maintain
3. **Inconsistent Props**: Different components use different prop structures for similar data
4. **Limited CMS Integration**: Netlify CMS configuration doesn't match the data structure used in components

## Netlify CMS Integration Details

### Current Setup

The site already uses Netlify CMS for content management. The CMS is configured in `public/admin/config.yml` and provides a user-friendly interface for managing content without needing to work directly with code. However, the current configuration is minimal and doesn't include many fields that are used in the components.

### Integration Strategy

To ensure our new components work seamlessly with Netlify CMS:

1. **Consistent Data Structure**
   - Ensure the data structure in CMS collections matches our TypeScript interfaces
   - Use the same field names in CMS config as in our interfaces
   - Add all missing fields currently used in components

2. **Preview Templates**
   - Create custom preview templates using our new components
   - This ensures content editors see an accurate representation of how their content will appear
   - Support both light and dark mode previews

3. **Media Management**
   - Configure the CMS media library to store images in the correct location
   - Implement image optimization for uploaded media
   - Support responsive image variants

4. **Markdown Processing**
   - Ensure our MDX processing pipeline handles all the formatting options available in the CMS
   - Add custom components for special content blocks if needed
   - Support code syntax highlighting and other advanced formatting

5. **Tag Management**
   - Implement a custom widget for tag selection that respects our tag categories (theme, type, time)
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for managing tags

### Example CMS Configuration Updates

# Example updates to public/admin/config.yml
collections:
  - name: "insights"

              - "retrospective"
      - {label: "Featured", name: "featured", widget: "boolean", default: false}
      - {label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown"}
```

### Preview Registration

```javascript
// Example preview registration in admin/index.js
import ArticlePreview from './previews/ArticlePreview';
import { registerWidgets } from './widgets';

// Register custom widgets
registerWidgets();

// Register preview templates
CMS.registerPreviewTemplate('insights', ArticlePreview);
```

### Custom Widgets Implementation

```javascript
// Example custom tag widget in admin/widgets/TagWidget.js
import React from 'react';
import { TagsControl, TagsPreview } from 'netlify-cms-widget-tags';

const TagsControlWrapper = (props) => {
  // Custom implementation that respects our tag categories
  return <TagsControl {...props} />;
};

export { TagsControlWrapper as Control, TagsPreview as Preview };
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Shared components reduce duplication and make updates easier
2. **Consistent User Experience**: Standardized components ensure visual consistency
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces prevent errors and improve developer experience
4. **Content Editor Experience**: Better CMS integration makes content management more intuitive
5. **Performance**: Optimized components improve site loading and rendering performance
6. **Accessibility**: Improved accessibility makes content available to all users
7. **SEO Optimization**: Better structured content improves search engine visibility
8. **Developer Onboarding**: Well-organized code makes it easier for new developers to understand the system

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks ✓ (Completed)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks ✓ (Completed)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks ✓ (Completed)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks (Next phase)

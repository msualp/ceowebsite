## Summary

The website is well-designed with a modern, Mac-inspired UI that effectively showcases Mustafa Sualp's personal brand and his company, Sociail. The site uses Next.js 13 with the App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and follows many modern web development best practices. The design is generally responsive and maintains consistency across different screen sizes.

A comprehensive design system has been implemented to ensure consistency across the site. This includes reusable components, standardized animations, consistent styling for interactive elements, and improved image handling. The design system has been applied to the homepage, about page, and journey page, with plans to extend it to the remaining pages.

Several key improvements have been implemented since the initial QA report, including image optimization, form validation, and URL format fixes in the sitemap. However, there are still some areas for improvement related to accessibility, performance optimization, and security that would further enhance the user experience and ensure the site meets the highest standards expected of a technology leader's personal website.

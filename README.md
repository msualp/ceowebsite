### Public vs Private Repository

**Recommendation:** This repository can be either public or private depending on your preferences:

- **Public Repository:** Choose this if you want to showcase your website's code as part of your portfolio or to allow others to learn from your implementation. This is a good choice for personal branding websites.

- **Private Repository:** Choose this if your website contains sensitive information or if you prefer to keep your implementation details private. This is recommended if you plan to include proprietary business information or unreleased product details.

# Improvements for Launch Checklist

This document outlines the necessary improvements and tasks to ensure a successful launch of the CEO brand website for Sociail, a collaborative AI and shared intelligence platform.

## How to Implement This Checklist

### Checklist Usage Guidelines

1. **Task Prioritization**:
   - Start with the "High Priority (Must-Have)" items first
   - Within each priority level, address items in the order listed
   - Tasks with dependencies on documentation marked as "Partially Implemented" should be prioritized
   - Complete all high-priority items before moving to medium-priority items

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Use the checkboxes ([ ]) to mark completed items
   - Add completion dates next to completed items for tracking purposes
   - For partially completed items, add notes about what remains to be done
   - Update the checklist weekly to reflect current status
   - Track high-level section progress using the section-level checkboxes.

3. **Team Collaboration**:
   - The CEO will supervise each section, and the Lead Engineer will implement the tasks
   - Schedule weekly review meetings to discuss progress and blockers
   - Use the checklist as a central reference during development meetings

### Supervision & Execution

Performance Optimization\n- **Third-Party Script Management**\n  - Use Next.js Script component with appropriate strategy (afterInteractive, lazyOnload)\n  - Prioritize critical scripts and defer non-essential ones\n  - Implement proper loading strategies for analytics and other third-party scripts\n\n- **Font Loading Strategy**\n  - Preload critical fonts to prevent layout shifts\n  - Optimize font loading with font-display: swap (already implemented)\n  - Consider using variable fonts to reduce file size\n\n- **Code Splitting**\n  - Review and optimize dynamic imports for client components\n  - Implement React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting\n  - Analyze bundle size and identify opportunities for optimization\n\n### 2. Comprehensive Audits\n\n- **Image Alt Text Audit**\n  - Review all images across the site\n  - Ensure descriptive alt text for all images\n  - Implement a process for maintaining alt text quality for new images\n\n- **Accessibility Audit**\n  - Conduct a comprehensive ARIA roles and labels audit\n  - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation\n  - Ensure all interactive elements are accessible\n  - Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio)\n\n- **Browser Compatibility Audit**\n  - Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\n  - Implement feature detection for critical features\n  - Ensure graceful degradation in older browsers\n  - Configure autoprefixer properly for CSS properties\n\n### 3. Security Enhancements\n\n- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**\n  - Tighten CSP rules to follow the principle of least privilege\n  - Implement nonce-based CSP for inline scripts\n  - Add report-uri directive to monitor CSP violations\n  - Test CSP in report-only mode before full implementation\n\n- **Form Security**\n  - Review and enhance server-side validation\n  - Implement rate limiting for form submissions\n  - Add honeypot fields to prevent spam\n\n### 4. Additional Improvements\n\n- **Meta Description Enhancement**\n  - Ensure all pages have unique, descriptive meta descriptions (120-160 characters)\n  - Optimize meta descriptions for search engines and click-through rates\n\n- **Remaining Pages Design System Implementation**\n  - Apply design system to any remaining pages\n  - Ensure consistent styling across all pages\n  - Refactor any legacy components to use the new design system\n\n- **Analytics and Monitoring**\n  - Implement proper event tracking for user interactions\n  - Set up performance monitoring\n  - Create a dashboard for key metrics\n\n## Timeline\n\n- **Week 1-2**: Performance optimization\n- **Week 3-4**: Comprehensive audits\n- **Week 5-6**: Security enhancements\n- **Week 7-8**: Additional improvements and final testing\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Next.js Script Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)\n- [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)\n- [Content Security Policy Reference](https://content-security-policy.com/)\n- [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)\n"

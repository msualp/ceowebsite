Ten years ago, I stood at the beginning of a journey that would transform how higher education approached assessment. Today, I find myself at a similar starting point, but this time focused on reinventing how humans and AI collaborate. While these might seem like disparate challenges, I've discovered surprising parallels that have shaped my approach to building Sociail.

### The AEFIS Beginning: A Mission Nobody Wanted
When we launched AEFIS, we faced a sector notoriously resistant to change—higher education. Our mission to transform assessment practices from summative evaluations to learning-centered approaches met skepticism and institutional inertia at every turn. The prevailing wisdom was clear: you can't change higher education, especially not in an area as entrenched as assessment.

What we discovered, however, was that the resistance wasn't to change itself but to solutions that didn't deeply understand the sector's unique challenges. By approaching assessment from the perspective of learning improvement rather than compliance, we found educators who shared our vision and were willing to champion it.

### Lesson 1: The Power of Mission-Driven Transformation
The conventional startup approach urges founders to find a pain point and solve it efficiently. But in complex, established systems like education or knowledge work, surface-level pain points often mask deeper systemic challenges. With AEFIS, we succeeded not because we had a marginally better assessment tool, but because we built around a mission to fundamentally change how institutions thought about learning and assessment.

This lesson directly informs Sociail's approach. We're not building just another productivity tool or a slightly better AI assistant. We're on a mission to fundamentally transform how humans and AI collaborate—a mission that recognizes the profound shift happening in knowledge work and aims to shape it in a human-centered direction.

### Lesson 2: Patience as a Competitive Advantage
In a startup world obsessed with rapid scaling, our journey with AEFIS taught me the power of patience. Transforming established systems requires time—time to build trust, time for early adopters to validate your approach, time for organizational change to take root.

We bootstrapped AEFIS for years, growing steadily rather than explosively. This approach allowed us to develop deep domain expertise, build lasting relationships, and refine our product based on real-world implementation rather than theoretical use cases. When we eventually secured professional seed investment, we had a battle-tested product and a loyal customer base.

With Sociail, I'm applying this same patient confidence. While we're building in a faster-moving space, we're focused on creating a foundation that can support transformative change, not just short-term traction. This means investing heavily in understanding the nuances of human-AI collaboration before rushing to scale.

### Lesson 3: The Surprising Connection Between Education and AI
Perhaps the most unexpected parallel between my work in EdTech and AI is the central importance of effective learning systems. At AEFIS, we built technology to enhance how institutions facilitate learning. At Sociail, we're creating systems where humans and AI learn continuously from each other.

The best educational approaches recognize that learning is social, contextual, and iterative. Similarly, the most effective AI collaboration happens when systems can maintain context, learn from interactions, and evolve alongside human collaborators. This insight has shaped Sociail's core architecture, which focuses on maintaining collaborative context rather than simply providing isolated AI capabilities.

### The Transition: From Exit to New Beginning
After successfully exiting AEFIS to private equity, I had a moment to reflect on what should come next. The rapid advances in AI presented not just a technological opportunity but a chance to shape how these powerful tools would integrate into human work and creativity.

Just as I saw education at a crossroads with assessment practices, I now see knowledge work at a similar inflection point with AI. The tools we build today will define whether AI primarily replaces human work or enhances our uniquely human capabilities. This mission—ensuring AI augments rather than diminishes human potential—drew me to found Sociail.

### Building Sociail: Applying Cross-Domain Wisdom
At Sociail, we're building on lessons from both education and early AI adoption:

1. **Focus on the human experience first**: Just as effective education puts learners at the center, effective AI collaboration must start with human needs and workflows.

2. **Build for contextual understanding**: Learning happens best when connected to context and prior knowledge. Similarly, AI collaboration tools must maintain context across interactions.

3. **Design for continuous evolution**: Both educational systems and AI tools must adapt based on experience and feedback.

### Looking Forward
As I lead Sociail toward beta launch and beyond, I carry forward the lessons of my AEFIS journey. The challenges differ, but the fundamental approach remains: identify transformative missions worth pursuing, build with patience and deep domain understanding, and focus on creating systems that enhance human potential rather than simply driving efficiency.

The frontier of human-AI collaboration offers even greater potential for impact than our work in education technology. By applying cross-domain wisdom and staying true to a human-centered mission, we aim to create a future where technology amplifies our creativity, connection, and collective intelligence.
